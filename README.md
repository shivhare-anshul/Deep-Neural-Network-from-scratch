Deep Neural Network from scratch on emotion data set . The data set is there in the repository. Also i uploaded the 2 different Implementation, One of them is using pytorch.

Problem Statement: Implementing BackPropagation

The above dataset has training/test subject faces with happy/sad emotion are provided in
the data. Each image is of 100Ã—100 matrix. Perform PCA to reduce the dimension from
10000 to K = 12. Implement a 2 hidden layer deep neural network (each layer containing
10 neurons) to classify the happy/sad classes. Use the cross entropy error function with
softmax output activations and ReLU hidden layer activations. Perform 20 iterations of
back propagation and plot the error on training data as a function of the iteration. What
is the test accuracy for this case and how does it change if the number of hiddent neurons
is increased to 15. Does momentum (with a momentum factor of 0.9) improve the learning
process ? Provide your detailed analysis.


Both of the implementations report is there with outputs. If anyone have any kind of doubt or something, please to mail me at
